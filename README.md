Welcome! I'm Lynsie, a full stack developer with a passion in frontend engineering (but I can do backend, too). 

I'm currently a freelance software developer and have over two and a half years of professional experience in the field. 

The technologies I use the most are Next.js, JavaScript, SQL Databases, and Azure Cloud Services. 

While I'm not a "vibe coder," I do find tools like Cursor and Copilot to be helpful in development for things like scaffolding components and debugging sytax errors.

I have a background in legal and find that my organization, communication, and attention to detail are very useful in my engineering career.

Outside of my profession, I'm an avid bowling and have been bowling for over two decades. (Feel free to ask for bowling tips - I got you.) ðŸŽ³
