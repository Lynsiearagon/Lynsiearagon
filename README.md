# Welcome! 

I'm Lynsie, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for frontend engineering (but I can do backend, too). 

I'm currently a freelance software developer and have over two and a half years of professional experience in the field. 

While I'm not a "vibe coder," I do find tools like Cursor and Copilot to be helpful for things like scaffolding components and debugging syntax errors. 

I have a background in legal and find that my organization, communication, and attention to detail are very useful in my engineering career.

## Bowling ðŸŽ³
Outside of my profession, I'm an avid bowler and have been bowling for over two decades, so feel free to ask for some bowling tips!
